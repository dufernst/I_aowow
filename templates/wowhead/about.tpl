					<h1>What is AOWOW?</h1>
<b>AOWOW</b> was created as an alternative for <b>Wowhead</b>, but this time for private servers. AOWOW providing World of Warcraft players with tools to make their gameplay more enjoyable and easier.<br /><br />
All the data in this website database are gathered from live servers on which you are playing every day, so you can access any quest, title, achievement and get relevant information about it.
<br /><br />
And finaly, the greatest part of our work is the Community (yep guys). You will be able to share with your feelings and information about achievements, quests, npcs', objects and items with other players, and if you stuck on any quest, you may ask for help in comments! Also, you can upload relevant screenshot to help people with ingame process!
<br /><br />
<h1>History</h1>
<img src="/images/history.jpg" class="rightimg">AOWOW development started in 2013 (though to be precise, it has continued in 2013). First, the plans was to create an accurate (as possible) Wowhead similarity database for a private server, but some how our client ruined all my plans and soon I moved this project to Github.<br /><br />
It was not easy, despite the fact that I already had the foundation for the base. Many things just did not work and i was facing two hard choices: to start from the beginning or to continue to work with the foundation, about which i didn't know anything.<br /><br />
But the decision was made and I have continued to develop what has been done before me. From that moment on Github was made over 200 commits, added more than 50 new features, redesigned almost all templates and javascript files.<br /><br />
And everything was fine, if not for one thing ... Many people downloaded the project, but did not give anything back (it's not about money but about the comments, about finding bugs and other things). I was a little insulted and unpleasant, and i've decided to transfer the project to the private repository. All that you will find on the Github now, is the base, which has been revised by me, but that does not have a lot of new features and tweaks.<br /><br />
What i want to say....<br /><br />
Respect human labor, in this case, the work of people on the server where you play. <br /><br />
I hope you read the text above the wall of the proposal and imbued with a little history of cration of this database that now you can see on this site.
